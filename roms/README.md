# CHIP-8 ROMs

This folder contains all CHIP-8 ROMs.

Use the rom_to_hex.cpp utility to convert them into a single ASCII hex file. Then you need to write the hex values into a sd card with no filesystem.
If you are on Windows you can use HxD to achive this.

## rom_to_hex usage:

`rom_to_hex.exe file1 <file2-64> `
